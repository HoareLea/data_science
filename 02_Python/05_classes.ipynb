    "Classes are a python structure which allow you to group data (attributes) and functions (methods) together in a single object. They are useful for providing a logical grouping of information and ways of interacting with that information. Classes are often used to represent abstract entities. For instance, a class could represent a person with attributes for name and date of birth plus a method to calculate their age based on their date of birth. "

    "We extend the previous example by defining methods which are effectively functions which act on the class. The first method `get_car_age` takes the current year as an argument and computes the age of the car. Note how within `get_car_age`, attributes of the class can be accessed via self.attribute. Methods such as these are called class methods and must have self as their first argument. Methods which do not reference any attributes or other methods of the class may omit the self argument. Such methods are called static methods and require the @staticmathod decorator. `count_wheels` is an example of a static method since it does not reference self anywhere in its definition. "

    "### Example - Inheritance\n",
    "Classes can be based on another class, inheriting all attributes and methods but allowing for those attributes and method to be overwritten in the subclass. In the example below, the ElectricCar class inherits from the Car class. Note that inheritance works only in one direction. That is, instances of the ElectricCar class are necessarily members of the Car class, but instances of the Car class are not necessarily members of the ElectricCar class. The super() method, allows you to access attributes and methods of the parent class. In the example, super() is leveraged to initialise the subclass using the parent class' `__init__` and then the subclass is extended by adding the battery_capacity attribute. The functionality of methods from the parent class can be extended or modified by creating a method of the same name in the subclass. When this method is called on an instance of the subclass, the logic defined in the subclass is used rather than the logic from the parent class. Additionally, further methods which only exist in the subclass can be defined (see get_battery_range_km wich doesn't exist in the parent Car class)"
