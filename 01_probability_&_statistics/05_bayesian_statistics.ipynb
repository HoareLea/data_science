    "### **Motivation**\n",
    "When modelling a random variable, we assume it arises from a probability distribution with unknown parameters that must be estimated. In frequentist statistics, parameters are treated as fixed constants. That is, we assume there is one true value for each parameter, and our goal is to estimate that value from the data. The fundamental idea behind **Bayesian** statistics is that unknown parameters are treated as variable. Since they are variable, the parameters themselves can also be treated as random variables with their own probability distributions. Our goal then becomes to estimate the target by estimating the probability distribution of the random variables that the parameters of the target distribution follow. In other words, we quantify uncertainty about parameters using probability; we represent greater uncertainty about a parameter by greater variance in its distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we model the heights of all the buildings in the world as coming from a normal distribution with known variance $\\sigma^2$ but unknown mean $\\mu$. Under frequentist statistics we would estimate $\\mu$ directly (for instance, via the sample mean), however withh a Bayesian approach we assign a probability distribution to the parameter $\\mu$. For instance we could model $\\mu$ as another normal distribution $\\mu \\sim N(\\mu_{\\mu}, \\sigma^2_{\\mu})$ with unknown mean $\\mu_{\\mu}$ and unknown variance $\\sigma^2_{\\mu}$. Notice how we have two different normal distributions going on here: \n",
    "- One describing the data (the likelihood),\n",
    "- One describing our uncertainty about the parameter \n",
    "A smaller variance represents greater prior confidence; a larger variance represents greater uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of Bayesian statistics is that we update the estimates for the parameters using the observed data. We start with a **prior** distribution, incorporate data through the likelihood, and obtain an updated **posterior** distribution. We can make estimates for the distributions of the parameters with little or no data and update these estimates as new data is observed. This approach often works well in real world scenarios. For example, suppose we are trying to estimate the probability that Arsenal will win the Premier League. A frequentist apporach would require us to have many examples of identical seasons in order to generate an estimate. But previous seasons involve different teams, players, managers etc. so aren't really representative of what will happen this season. So we do not have directly comparable observations to draw from. Nevertheless, this prior information is informative in some way, albeit not directly. A Bayesian approach allows us to leverage information that may exist latently about a problem but not necessarily in the form of observed data. We can build a prior distribution which captures this information and update it as data becomes available (e.g. after each match). "
