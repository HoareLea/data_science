    "### **Data, Sample Space & Events**\n",
    "**Data** are organised information relating to a thing or process. The data can be **continuous** meaning they can take any value (possibly within a range) or **discrete** meaning they can only take a finite number of possible values. For example height is a continuous variable since it can be any positive value whereas traffic light colour is discrete because it can only take three values (red, amber, green). Note data is the plural form of the singular datum. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example, when flipping a coin, the sample space is $𝑆=\\{𝐻,𝑇\\}$ whereas when rolling a die, it is $𝑆=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is any subset of the sample space — that is, a collection of outcomes we are interested in. For instance, when rolling a die, the event *“rolling an even number”* is $E=\\{2,4,6\\}$ which is a subset of the full sample space."

    "### **Independence & Dependence**\n",
    "**Independence** is a central idea within staistics. Intuitively, it captures the notion that the outcome of one event does not effect the outcome for another event. For instance, when flipping a fair coin, the probability of heads is unrelated to whether or not we got heads last on the previous flip. The converse of independence is dependence and relates to events whose outcomes do affect one another. For example the temperature in London today is related to the temperature yesterday or on this day last year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically we capture the idea of independence as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two events, $A,B$ are independent if and only if $\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\mathbb{P}(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this captures the notion of the two events being unrelated notice that for independent event $A,B$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)} = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A)\\mathbb{P}(B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)} = \\mathbb{P}(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the probability of event $A$ given that $B$ has occured is just the probability of event $A$; the chance that $A$ occurs is unrelated to whether or not $B$ has occured. "
