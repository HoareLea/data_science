    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customise to solve a recurring design problem in your code. You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own problem. Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different. An useful analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical sections in a pattern description are as follows:\n",
    "- **Intent**: Briefly describes both the problem and the solution\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible\n",
    "- **Class Structure**: Shows each part of the pattern and how they are related\n",
    "- **Code Example**: Example implementation in a popular popular programming language\n",
    "- **Other Details (Optional)**: Some patterns list other useful details such as applicability of the pattern, implementation steps and relations with other patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above was adapted from [refactoring-guru](!https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) which an excellent resource for understanding design patterns. "

    "### **Factory Pattern**\n",
    "The factory design pattern aims to centralise the code for object creation. It is particularly useful in the case where there are many variants of an object which share some functionality but may have some differences in other aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "It contains the following:\n",
    "1. **Abstract Base Class**: This encapsulates all the default behaviour that will be shared across all variants.\n",
    "2. **Concrete Implementations of the Abstract Base Class**: These inherit from the abstract base class but can overwrite or extend its\n",
    "   functionality\n",
    "3. **Abstract Factory Class**: This should contain a method for creating objects which calls the concrete classes' `init` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several benefits of utilising the factory pattern:\n",
    "- All the logic which decides which type of object should be created is housed in one central place (namely the create method within the abstract factory class). Without the factory pattern, this logic would need to be included everywhere that objects are initialised in the client code\n",
    "- The factory pattern allows us to call methods on objects without explicitly needing to know their class. The specific implementation is automatically handled by the concrete class implementations.\n",
    "- The functionality that makes object variants different from one another is housed in a single place (namely the concrete classes). Without the factory pattern, every class method would need logic which switches the behaviour depending on the variant. This could get very verbose if there were many variants or if the logic was complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we show a simple implementation of the factory design pattern. The motivation is to create two variants of a button, one for iOS and one for Android. By implementing the factory design pattern we allow the client code to operate on the button via `.render()` without needing the be aware of whether the button is the iOS or Android variant. "
